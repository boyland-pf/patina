# Projects

You will be writing your compiler in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), a modern functional language used by [Facebook](https://fbinfer.com/), [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/technology/#work-functionally), [Galois](https://github.com/GaloisInc?language=ocaml), and [many more companies](https://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html).

If this is your first time programming in a functional language, it is our secret agenda that by the end of the course, you will start to wonder, "perhaps the world will be a better place if there is more functional programming."

A project will consist of several problems, each annotated with the expected level of difficulty (✭ ~ ✭✭✭✭✭).
