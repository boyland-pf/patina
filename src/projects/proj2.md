## Project 2: Lexing and Parsing

### Part 1

> Goal of this exercise: Familiarizing yourself with the Patina language

You will write some simple programs in the Patina language. We'll provide a prototype interpreter for you to play with. The prototype is quite crappy: it won't have a type checker, and its error handling will be bad. By the end of this course your compiler will be much better than ours. 

### Part 2

> Goal of this exercise: Use the `ocamllex` lexer generator to write a lexer.

<!-- TODO: Provide a more precise spec here -->

### Part 3: Parser

> Goal of this exercise: Use the `ocamlyacc` parser generator to write a parser.

<!-- TODO: Provide a more precise spec here -->
