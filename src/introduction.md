# Introduction

This manual describes the Patina programming language, which is an imperative language whose syntax is very similar to the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Patina is big enough to let you write many interesting programs (e.g. your favorite sorting algorithm), but small enough that a compiler for Patina can be implemented in a quarter-long course.
