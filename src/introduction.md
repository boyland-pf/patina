# Introduction

The first half of this manual describes the Patina programming language, which is an imperative language whose syntax is very similar to the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Patina is big enough to let you write many interesting programs (e.g. your favorite sorting algorithm), but small enough that a compiler for Patina can be implemented in a quarter-long course.


The second half describes the programming projects. They build on each other, and in the end you will have a complete, optimizing compiler that can translate any Patina program down to x86 assembly, which your computer will be able to execute.
