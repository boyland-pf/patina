## Integer Expressions

The most basic expressions in Patina are integer constants, and they can be composed into larger expressions using binary arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. For example,
```rust,no_run,noplayground
(1 + 2) / 3 * 4 
```
is a valid Patina expression with value `4`. Negative integers are written in the usual way, e.g. `-2`.

Integer expressions have type `int`.
